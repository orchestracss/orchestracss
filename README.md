**Experiment:** What if CSS becomes the orchestrator, browser - the runtime?

## Idea
Using ONLY native browser features (2026 baseline):
✅ OKLCH colors (no more HEX)
✅ light-dark() auto themes (no JS toggles)  
✅ Container Queries (kill media queries)
🚧 Anchor Positioning (tooltips without JS)
🚧 Scroll-driven animations (no JS libs)

## I Need Your Roast
This is just an experiment. Probably stupid architecture.

**Please criticize:**
1. Is OKLCH ready for production?
2. What native features are missing?
3. Would you use this or it's bullshit?

## What's Here
- `tokens.css` - OKLCH color system (needs critique)
- More coming (if this makes sense)

## Not Another Framework
Orchestra is a PROTOCOL, not a framework:
- CSS as logic language (:has(), @container)
- Tokens as JSON API for AI
- Browser as platform (no polyfills)

Star if you want to see where this goes. 
Or tell me it's garbage. Both help. 🔥
